# Sumple
CS308-Term Project

The project involved creating a sample library application with various functionalities.I contributed as a frontend developer in this project which utilized ReactJS and CSS. It included features such as a rating system, chatbox for community interaction, and an extensive collection of downloadable samples. The application allowed users to perform song-based and artist-based searches, incorporating a filtering system. Additionally, users could send remix requests to artists or their representatives. The project also implemented a recommendation system based on user data and genre/artist interests. Throughout the development, we focused on optimizing the search mechanism and created screens like User Profile, Agreements, Search, Login, and Recommendation.
